"""Build this topic's module from the proven video-03 head of the Chapter 3
quadrilaterals set.

That module is the untouched head of the series: the theme and board constants,
the chalkboard backdrop with the student, the teacher and both corner badges,
`reset_board`, `appear`, the crisp-text pacing helpers, the card helpers and the
ground-truth SRT export.  None of that is topic-specific, so it is kept verbatim
and only the topic-specific parts are replaced:

  * the module docstring,
  * the narration table and this topic's polygon furniture,
  * the class name and the output path,
  * `_capture_srt` (the series version folds a one-or-two-word tail chunk into
    the caption before it, so no caption lands mostly in silence),
  * every scene beat.

Run from this folder:
    python assemble_polygons.py

Polygons Explained: Sides, Vertices, Adjacent Elements & Diagonals
Story-mode chalkboard lesson (Telangana Class 6 Maths, Chapter 4: Basic
Geometrical Ideas, Storymode 03).

LLM KEY / FUNCTION NAME: polygons_sides_vertices_and_diagonals

Production pipeline (mirrors the rest of the Story-Mode series):
  - Shared assets/background2.png chalkboard backdrop + student/teacher
    cutouts + corner badges (dhimantAI top-left, Mathematics top-right).
  - VoiceoverScene + speech service; narration written as continuous prose.
  - Real per-word sync via <bookmark> tags + tracker timing, and a
    ground-truth SRT export from the service word boundaries.
  - Sound effects from sound_effects.py; chalk-styled Text (Segoe Print) and
    MathTex; shared story_common.play_challenge_countdown() for the THINK clock.
  - Text appears crisply and the board then HOLDS; diagram work is paced across
    its window, words are not.
  - Nothing on the board sits below y = -2.00: the burned-in caption grows up
    from the bottom of the frame.

The defining visual is ONE PERSISTENT QUADRILATERAL ABCD, built piece by piece:
the straight sides snap closed, the boundary is traced, the vertices pulse, the
adjacent and opposite parts are highlighted, and the two dashed diagonals are
drawn across the same figure.  Diagrams are drawn realistically -- solid vertex
dots, thick chalk sides, a soft interior tint and dashed diagonals.

Title + 10 scenes:
  0. Title card.
  1. From a closed curve to a polygon: the smooth boundary straightens.
  2. What a polygon must have: segments + closed + simple, three is the start.
  3. Sides and vertices of triangle ABC.
  4. Quadrilateral ABCD: four sides, four vertices.
  5. Adjacent sides (AB with BC and DA) and neighbouring vertices.
  6. Opposite side CD and the opposite vertex pairs A-C and B-D.
  7. Diagonals AC and BD join the opposite vertices.
  8. Side vs diagonal: boundary against the interior connection.
  9. Your turn: quadrilateral PQRS after the centred ten-second THINK clock.
 10. Recap: sides -> vertices -> adjacent -> diagonals, and the spoken
     thank-you card.
