"""Build this topic's module from the proven video-03 head of the Chapter 3
quadrilaterals set.

That module is the untouched head of the series: the theme and board constants,
the chalkboard backdrop with the student, the teacher and both corner badges,
`reset_board`, `appear`, the crisp-text pacing helpers, the card helpers and the
ground-truth SRT export.  None of that is topic-specific, so it is kept verbatim
and only the topic-specific parts are replaced:

  * the module docstring,
  * the narration table and this topic's angle furniture,
  * the class name and the output path,
  * `_capture_srt` (the series version folds a one-or-two-word tail chunk into
    the caption before it, so no caption lands mostly in silence),
  * every scene beat.

Run from this folder:
    python assemble_angles.py

Understanding Angles: Vertex, Arms, and Angle Regions
Story-mode chalkboard lesson (Telangana Class 6 Maths, Chapter 4: Basic
Geometrical Ideas, Storymode 04).

LLM KEY / FUNCTION NAME: angles_vertex_arms_and_regions

Production pipeline (mirrors the rest of the Story-Mode series):
  - Shared assets/background2.png chalkboard backdrop + student/teacher
    cutouts + corner badges (dhimantAI top-left, Mathematics top-right).
  - VoiceoverScene + speech service; narration written as continuous prose.
  - Real per-word sync via <bookmark> tags + tracker timing, and a
    ground-truth SRT export from the service word boundaries.
  - Sound effects from sound_effects.py; chalk-styled Text (Segoe Print) and
    MathTex; shared story_common.play_challenge_countdown() for the THINK clock.
  - Text appears crisply and the board then HOLDS; diagram work is paced across
    its window, words are not.
  - Nothing on the board sits below y = -2.00: the burned-in caption grows up
    from the bottom of the frame.

The defining visual is the OPENING-DOOR ANGLE: one persistent vertex O, one arm
held fixed, and a second ray that swings open like a door -- then the same angle
is revealed in layers (vertex, arms, the three-letter name with the vertex in
the middle, the filled interior marker, the boundary arms and the exterior).

Title + 10 scenes:
  0. Title card: two rays, one vertex, three regions.
  1. What makes an angle: the opening door and the clock hands.
  2. Building angle AOB from the common endpoint O.
  3. The vertex and the two arms (also called sides).
  4. The naming rule: with three letters the vertex is the middle letter.
  5. angle AOB = angle BOA, and the short name angle O.
  6. The interior: the region between the arms (point X).
  7. Boundary and exterior (points S and Z) -- three parts of the plane.
  8. Sorting points on angle PQR: M interior, N boundary, T exterior.
  9. Your turn: vertex/arms, two names, region sorting, the wrong name --
     after the series' centred ten-second THINK clock.
 10. Recap: build -> name -> locate, and the spoken thank-you card.
