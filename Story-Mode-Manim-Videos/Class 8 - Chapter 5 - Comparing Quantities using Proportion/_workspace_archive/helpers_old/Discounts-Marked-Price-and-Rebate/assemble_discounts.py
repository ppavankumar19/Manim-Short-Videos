"""Build this topic's module from the proven head of the Chapter 3
quadrilaterals set.

That module is the untouched head of the series: the theme and board constants,
the chalkboard backdrop with the student, the teacher and both corner badges,
`reset_board`, `appear`, the crisp-text pacing helpers and the ground-truth SRT
export.  None of that is topic-specific, so it is kept verbatim and only the
topic-specific parts are replaced:

  * the module docstring,
  * the narration table and this topic's shop-counter furniture,
  * the class name and the output path,
  * `_capture_srt` (the series version folds a one-or-two-word tail chunk into
    the caption before it, so no caption lands mostly in silence),
  * every scene beat.

Finding Discounts & Marked Price: Calculating SP and Discount Percentages
Story-mode chalkboard lesson (Class 8 Maths, Chapter 5: Comparing Quantities
using Proportion, Storymode 02).

LLM KEY / FUNCTION NAME: discounts_marked_price_and_rebate

Production pipeline (mirrors the rest of the Story-Mode series):
  - Shared assets/background2.png chalkboard backdrop + student/teacher
    cutouts + corner badges (dhimantAI top-left, Mathematics top-right).
  - VoiceoverScene + speech service; narration written as continuous prose.
  - Real per-word sync via <bookmark> tags + tracker timing, and a
    ground-truth SRT export from the service word boundaries.
  - Sound effects from sound_effects.py; chalk-styled Text (Segoe Print) and
    MathTex; shared story_common.play_challenge_countdown() for the THINK clock.
  - Text appears crisply and the board then HOLDS; diagram work is paced across
    its window, words are not.
  - Nothing on the board sits below y = -2.00: the burned-in caption grows up
    from the bottom of the frame.

The defining visual is THE SHOP TAG AND THE CUT PRICE BAR: the marked price
written on a tag (the price that never disappears), the glossy percent sticker
stuck on it, the drawn book / bicycle / ceiling fan that carry their own price
plates, the 100% = marked-price bar with the discount portion physically cut
off it and slid aside, and the two bars whose visible gap is the discount in
rupees before it moves up to become the discount percentage.

Title + 10 scenes:
  0. Title card: the tag says Rs 1600, the sticker says 6% off, and the three
     quantities (marked price, discount or rebate, selling price) are named.
  1. The three parts and the one relation MP - Discount = SP.
  2. A book marked Rs 80 at 15% off: find the discount, then the selling price.
  3. A cycle marked Rs 3600 sold for Rs 3312: the Rs 288 gap becomes 8%, and the
     base is the MARKED PRICE, not the selling price.
  4. A fan marked Rs 1600 with 6% off: Rs 96 off, Rs 1504 payable -- and the
     discount AMOUNT is kept apart from the discount RATE.
  5. The shortcut: 6% off leaves 94%, so SP = 94/100 x 1600; both routes land on
     Rs 1504, and SP = (100 - d)/100 x MP.
  6. Which formula? A decision board for the three question shapes.
  7. Common mistakes, each struck through with a drawn cross beside its fix.
  8. Reasonableness: a discount means SP < MP, and d% off leaves (100 - d)%.
  9. Your turn: four corner prompts, the series' centred ten-second THINK clock,
     then the answers for A, B and C.
 10. Recap: the price flow tag, reduce, pay, compare -- and the spoken
     thank-you card.
